    <td>Faster actions and decisions: A.I. and cognitive technologies help in making faster actions and decisions. "Areas like automated fraud detection, planning and scheduling further demonstrate this benefit," said Kalyan Kumar, executive vice president at HCL Technologies, an IT services provider in India.</td>
    <td>Job losses: There is no way around it, AI will cost lesser-skilled people their jobs. Robots have already taken many jobs on assembly lines and as AI gets better at doing complex tasks, even more low-skill jobs will be taken.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Machine Learning: Big Data means datasets in the petabytes, far too much for a human to sift through. AI can chew through that data as fast as the Xeon processors in the servers can go and derive insights from the data much faster than any human could.</td>
    <td>A concentration of power: AI could mean a lot of power will be in the hands of a few who are controlling it. "AI de-humanizes warfare as the nations in possession of advanced AI technology can kill humans without involving an actual human to pull the trigger," said Schneiderhan.
